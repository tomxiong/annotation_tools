- Organization preferences: Clean separation of concerns

### ✅ Current Project State
- Reflects the actual file structure after cleanup
- Points to correct file paths and directories
- References working launcher scripts and testing tools
- Acknowledges the archived files for historical reference

### ✅ User Experience
- Clear, actionable instructions
- Multiple options for different user preferences
- Comprehensive troubleshooting for common issues
- Easy navigation and quick reference

## Removed Outdated Content

### From README.md:
- Complex CLI command references (moved to archive)
